npx create-react-app kasa-app --template typescript

Creating a new React app in /Users/beverlywilson/kasa-app.

We detected TypeScript in your project (src/App.test.tsx) and created a tsconfig.json file for you.

Your tsconfig.json has been populated with default values.

To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.

Created git commit.

Success! Created kasa-app at /Users/beverlywilson/kasa-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd kasa-app
  npm start


npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest

npx tsc --init
